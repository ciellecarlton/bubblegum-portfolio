# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This is a very rough draft of what my portfolio could look like in the future. 

I learned how to create a responsive page with this assignment. 

edit: I recived a B on this assignment at first because the sizing was not consistant.
throughout the pages. Iedited them and also added some bootstrap styling aspects for a better grade! 

Thanks :3
