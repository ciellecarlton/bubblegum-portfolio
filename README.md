# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This is a very rough draft of what my portfolio could look like for me in the future a sa developer.

I learned how to create a responsive page with this assignment as well as in-line css. 

edit: I recived a "B" on this assignment at first because the sizing was not consistant
throughout the pages. I edited them and also added some bootstrap styling aspects for a better grade! 

Thanks :3
